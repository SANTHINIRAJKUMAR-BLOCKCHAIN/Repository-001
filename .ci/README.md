# !! DO NOT MODIFY THE API FILE IN THIS DIRECTORY !!

The `api-current.txt` file contains a summary of Corda's current public APIs,
as generated by the `api-scanner` Gradle plugin. (See [here](../gradle-plugins/api-scanner/README.md) for a detailed description of this plugin.)

Deleting or changing the existing Corda APIs listed in `api-current.txt` may
break developers' CorDapps in the next Corda release! Please remember that we
have committed to API Stability for CorDapps.
