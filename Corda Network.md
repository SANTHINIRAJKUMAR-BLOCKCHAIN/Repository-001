Corda Network

==============

 

Introduction to Corda Network

\------------------

 

Corda Network consists of Corda nodes operated by network participants, in which business transactions are created and validated via Corda Distributed Applications (CorDapps) running on these nodes. Each node is identified by means of a certificate issued by the Network’s Certificate Authority and will also be identifiable on a network map. 

 

Corda Network enables interoperability – the exchange of data or assets via a secure, efficient internet layer – in a way that isn’t possible with competing permissioned distributed ledger technologies or legacy systems.

 

The network is due to go live in November, after which it will be governed by R3. An independent, not for profit Foundation is currently being set-up which is intended to govern the Network from mid 2019, after a transition period.

 

 

Relationship between Corda Network and Business Networks

\--------------------------

 

The Network will comprise of many sub-groups or ‘business networks’ of participants running particular CorDapps, and such groups will often have a co-ordinating party (the ‘Business Network Operator’) who manages the distribution of the app and rules for its use. 

 

Corda Network will support the operation of business networks by industry-specific operators within the Network. There will be a clear separation between areas of governance for the Network and for individual business networks. For example, rules around membership of business networks will be controlled by its Business Network Operators 

 

Additionally, the structure and control processes of the Foundation shall be documented and made available under a Creative Commons license, both for reuse by business network operators if business networks need a similar governance structure, and so that such governance layers are complementary and not contradictory.

  

 

Governance Structure

\-------------------------------

 

We at R3 believe it is critically important that we should not control Corda Network going forwards, and that it should be governed transparently to its members, with a fair and representative structure that can deliver a stable operating environment for its members for the long term.



 

After legal advice we have decided to set up a Corda Network Foundation, a not-for-profit legal entity residing in the Netherlands, known as a Stichting. This is a legal entity suited for governance activities, able to act commercially, with limited liability but no shareholders, capital or dividends. It is defined in a set of Articles of Association and By-laws.

 

A Foundation will enable Network members to be involved with, and also understand, how decisions are made (including around issues of identity and permission), building trust and engagement from a wide range of stakeholders. We believe this will bring about the best decisions and outcomes for the Network’s long-term success. 

 

Its governance bodies shall include

 

1. A **Governing Board** (‘the Board’) of 11      representatives (‘Directors’). 
2. A **Technical Advisory** **Committee** (‘the TAC’), comprised of representatives of Member      organisations. 
3. A **Governance Advisory Committee**, comprised of      representatives of Member organisations. 
4. A **Network Operator** (‘the Operator’), charging      the Foundation reasonable costs for providing network and administration      services, paid by the Foundation through membership funds, and accountable      directly to the Board.

 

Operating on behalf of:

1. **Participants** (‘Participants’),      which is open to any organisation participating in the Corda Network,      independent of R3 membership and direct Network participation.
