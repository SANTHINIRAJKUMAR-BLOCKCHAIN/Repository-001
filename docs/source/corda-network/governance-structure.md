Governance Structure
====================

We at R3 believe it is critically important that we should not control Corda Network going forwards, and that it should be governed transparently to its members, with a fair and representative structure that can deliver a stable operating environment for its members for the long term.

After legal advice we have decided to set up a Corda Network Foundation, a not-for-profit legal entity residing in the Netherlands, known as a Stichting. This is a legal entity suited for governance activities, able to act commercially, with limited liability but no shareholders, capital or dividends. It is defined in a set of Articles of Association and By-laws.

A Foundation will enable Network members to be involved with, and also understand, how decisions are made (including around issues of identity and permission), building trust and engagement from a wide range of stakeholders. We believe this will bring about the best decisions and outcomes for the Network’s long-term success. 

Its governance bodies shall include:

- A **Governing Board** (‘the Board’) of 11 representatives (‘Directors’). 
- A **Technical Advisory** **Committee** (‘the TAC’), comprised of representatives of Participant organisations. 
- A **Governance Advisory Committee**, comprised of representatives of Participant organisations. 
- A **Network Operator** (‘the Operator’), charging the Foundation reasonable costs for providing network and administration services, paid by the Foundation through membership funds, and accountable directly to the Board.

Operating on behalf of:

- **Participants** (‘Participants’), open to any legal entity participating in the Corda Network, independent of R3 membership and direct Network participation.
