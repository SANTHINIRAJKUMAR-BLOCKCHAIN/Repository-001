Deploying Corda to Corda Testnet from an Azure Cloud Platform VM
================================================================

.. contents::

This document explains how to deploy a Corda node to Azure that can connect directly to the Corda Testnet. A self service download link can be obtained from https://testnet.corda.network. This document will describe how to set up a virtual machine on the Azure Cloud Platform to deploy your pre-configured Corda node and automatically connnect to Testnet.

Pre-requisites
--------------
* Ensure you have a registered Microsoft Azure account which can create virtual machines and you are logged on to the Azure portal: https://portal.azure.com.


Deploy Corda node
-----------------

Browse to https://portal.azure.com and log in with your Microsoft account.


**STEP 1: Create a Resource Group**

Click on the "Resource groups" link in the side nav in the Azure
Portal and then click "Add":

Fill in the form and click "Create":

**STEP 2: Launch the VM**

At the top of the left sidenav click on the button with the green cross "Create a resource".

In this example we are going to use an Ubuntu server so select the latest Ubuntu Server option.

Fill in the form:

.. image:: resources/azure-vm-form.png

Add a username (to log into the VM) and choose and enter a password.

Choose the resource group we created earlier from the "Use existing" dropdown.

Select a cloud region geographically near to your location to host your VM.

Click on OK.

Choose the "D4S_V3 Standard" option and click "Select":

Click on "Public IP address" to open the settings panel

Set the IP address to "Static" under Assignment. 

.. note:: This is so the IP address for your node does not change rapidly in the global network map.

Click OK.

Next click on "Network security group (firewall)":

Add inbound rules for ports 8080 (webserver), and
10002-10003 for the P2P and RPC ports used by the Corda node
respectively:

Add 3 rules with the following port, name and priorities:

.. code:: bash

    Port range: 10002, Priority: 1041  Name: Port_10002
    Port range: 10003, Priority: 1042  Name: Port_10003
    Port range: 8080, Priority: 1043  Name: Port_8080

.. note:: The priority has to be unique number in the range 900
	  (highest) and 4096 (lowest) priority. Make sure each rule
	  has a unique priority or there will be a validation failure and error message.

Click OK and OK again on the Settings panel.

Click "Create" and wait a few minutes for your instance to provision
and start running.

**STEP 3: Connect to your VM and set up the environment**

Once your instance is running click on the "Connect" button and copy the ssh command:

.. image:: resources/azure-ssh.png

Enter the ssh command into your terminal. At the prompt to continue connecting type yes and then enter the password you configured earlier to log into the remote VM:

.. image:: resources/azure-shell.png


**STEP 4: Download and set up your Corda node**

Now your Azure environment is configured you can switch to the Testnet 
web application and click on the copy to clipboard button to get a one
time installation script. 

.. note:: If you have not already set up your account on Testnet then please visit https://testnet.corda.network and sign up.

You can generate as many Testnet identites as you like by refreshing
this page to generate a new one time link. 
	   
In the terminal of your cloud instance paste the command you just copied to install and run
your unique Corda node:

.. code:: bash

    sudo ONE_TIME_DOWNLOAD_KEY=YOUR_UNIQUE_DOWNLOAD_KEY_HERE bash -c "$(curl -L https://testnet.corda.network/api/user/node/install.sh)"

.. warning:: This command will execute the install script as ROOT on your cloud instance. You may wish to examine the script prior to executing it on your machine. 

You can follow the progress of the installation by typing the following command in your terminal:

.. code:: bash

    tail -f /opt/corda/logs/node-<VM-NAME>.log

Once the node has booted up you can navigate to the external web address of the instance on port 8080. If everything is working you should see the following:

Testing your deployment
-----------------------

To test your deployment is working correctly follow the instructions in :doc:`testnet-explorer-corda` to set up the Finance CorDapp and issue cash to a counterparty.

This will also demonstrate how to install a custom CorDapp.
